<h1>Employee Directory</h1>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>The employee directory uses a combination of JavaScript and DOM Manipulation to create a Single Page App that allows the user to view an employee directory, add to the directory, edit existing listings, verify the existence of a name within the directory and delete an entry in the directory. All done in a soothing "cadet blue" color scheme.</p>
